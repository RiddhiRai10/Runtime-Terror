Problem Statement

Design, develop, and deploy an open-source web-based recommendation engine that curates a customised schedule for guests visiting a specific region, reducing the time necessary for tour preparation.

Objective
We aim to make travel planning easier by creating a personalised itinerary.

Tech Stack
To achieve the best level of customer satisfaction, we incorporate user preferences while modelling the itinerary.
We aim to provide a user-friendly interface that helps customers to find the best itinerary in the shortest amount of time.
Collaborative filtering models make predictions based on a dataset of user feedback to destinations (typically ratings).
Content- based models rely solely on the destinations’ unique characteristics (like the location, popularity, proximity to popular tourist attractions). Because hybrid DL models are non-linear, they are less likely to simplify a user’s preferences.
Django is a production-ready framework for quickly deploying applications in high-volume environments. Because it is a python- based framework, it can natively incorporate various ML models such as TensorFlow and Pytorch

Models & Accuracy Calculation
After testing various models the results need to be analyzed on the testing set and come up with the most suitable method to plan your itinerary
